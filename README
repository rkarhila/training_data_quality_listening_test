This is my listening test code and is distributed with
my infinite kindness. If it happens to be usedful to you,
and you're a researcher and make a paper with its help,
don't forget to add me in the "thank you" section of the
paper. Citing would be nice but I don't think there is 
anything relevant to cite for scripts like these.


You will need a conf.php file that includes information
about the location of the script URL and the place where 
to write the result files inside the file system.

copy it from conf.php.template



Best of luck,
  Reima
